# NYC Uber Pick-up Data Analysis
🚕🗺️ Welcome to the NYC Uber Pick-up Data Analysis project! 📊🔍

In this project, I explore and visualize the Uber pick-up data of the vibrant New York City. Utilizing data analysis and engineering techniques, I uncover fascinating insights into the city's movement and rhythms. The visualizations created using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium bring the data to life, allowing us to witness the heartbeat of NYC in real-time.

🏙️🌐 The project takes you on an exciting journey through data-driven storytelling, showcasing the patterns and trends in Uber pick-ups, from busy rush hours to late-night adventures. Whether you're a data enthusiast, city explorer, or simply curious about the digital pulse of NYC, this project is sure to leave you captivated!
